Greetings! I'm Bruce, a Ph.D. student at the [UCLA HCI lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Xiang 'Anthony' Chen](https://hci.prof/).

I'm a human-AI researcher building the <b>future forms of LLMs and AI agents</b> that understand more deeply, interact more naturally, and align more seamlessly with humans.
For example, interfaces where users can steer AI’s thoughts mid-conversation ([ThinkaloudLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18676)), agents that proactively engage in group conversations by modeling intrinsic motivation ([Inner Thoughts](https://liubruce.me/inner_thoughts/)), and multimodal agents that adapts to and stays in sync with real-world constraints ([Human I/O](https://liubruce.me/human_io/)).


My work has been recognized and supported by an [Amazon Ph.D. Fellowship](https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/2023-amazon-fellows/), an [ACM UIST Best Paper Award 🏆](https://programs.sigchi.org/uist/2022/awards/best-papers), two [ACM CHI Best Paper Honorable Mentions 🏅](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/148270), an [ED Rice Outstanding Master Student Award 🎓 ](https://samueli.ucla.edu/2023-samueli-awards/), and a [Distinguished Master's Thesis Research Award 🎓 ](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/ece-department-2021-2022-outstanding-student-awards-announced/) at UCLA. I also held research internships at [Google](https://research.google/), [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) and [Snap Research](https://www.snap.com/en-US).
