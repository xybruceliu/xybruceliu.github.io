Greetings! I'm Bruce, a Ph.D. student at the [UCLA HCI lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Xiang 'Anthony' Chen](https://hci.prof/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>HCI</b> and <b>AI</b>. 
I design and build systems that enable humans to interact with AI in ways that go beyond the traditional dyadic, turn-based paradigm.
Recently, I've been exploring how to leverage AI's "thoughts" 💭 as a first-class citizen in human-AI interaction.
My work spans various application domains including communication, accessibility, and augmented reality.

My work has been recognized and supported by an [Amazon Ph.D. Fellowship](https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/2023-amazon-fellows/) (2023), an [ACM UIST Best Paper Award 🏆](https://programs.sigchi.org/uist/2022/awards/best-papers) (2022), two [ACM CHI Best Paper Honorable Mentions 🏅](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/148270) (2023, 2024), an [ED Rice Outstanding Master Student Award 🎓 ](https://samueli.ucla.edu/2023-samueli-awards/) (2023), and a [Distinguished Master's Thesis Research Award 🎓 ](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/ece-department-2021-2022-outstanding-student-awards-announced/) (2022) at UCLA. I also held research internships at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), [Google](https://research.google/) and [Snap Research](https://www.snap.com/en-US).
